# IST256GitDemo
This is a Demo Repository for the IST 256 Assignment.

For this demo, I have created a repository. Then, I cloned the repository. This is followed by creating a branch for adding information to the ReadMe.
This information is being written in the new branch but will be merged to the main branch.
